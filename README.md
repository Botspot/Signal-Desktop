# Signal Unofficial (arm64)

This repository is a fork of the official Signal destop with added support for arm64 on Windows and Apple Silicon you can download our [releases](https://github.com/dennisameling/Signal-Desktop/releases) for your device.

## Ending support for Signal Unofficial on macOS

The Signal team has introduced official Apple Silicon support in version [5.27.1](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/releases/tag/v5.27.1). This means that we won't be creating new builds of Signal Unofficial on macOS moving forward as there's no need for it anymore. The good news is that you can keep your message history when switching back to the official client!

1. Download the official macOS client [from the Signal website](https://signal.org/nl/download/).
2. Follow the steps in the "Migrate from Signal Unofficial to Signal Official" section below to copy your data over to the official client
3. Enjoy official Signal Apple Silicon support!

Version **5.33.0** will be the final macOS build of Signal Unofficial. New versions will only be released for the Windows platform moving forward. Users will see an in-app dialog telling them to switch over to the official client.

## Tips and Tricks
### Migrate from Signal Unofficial to Signal Official on macOS using the terminal (recommended when Signal Official has arm64 support)

```mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/Signal ~/Library/Application\ Support/SignalBACKUP && cp -R -v ~/Library/Application\ Support/Signal\ Unofficial ~/Library/Application\ Support/Signal```

1. This backs up the Signal folder
